# Riju

Riju is a very fast online playground for every programming language.
In less than a second, you can start playing with a Python interpreter
or compiling INTERCAL code.

Check out the [live application](https://riju.codes/)!

**You should not write any sensitive code on Riju, as NO GUARANTEES
are made about the security or privacy of your data. (No warranty etc
etc.)**

This project is a work in progress, and I don't intend on thoroughly
documenting it until it has reached feature-completeness.

## Documentation

* [Criteria for language inclusion](doc/what-languages.md)
* [How to add your own language to Riju](doc/tutorial.md)
* [Deep dive on Riju build system](doc/build.md)
* [Deploying your own instance of Riju](doc/infrastructure.md)

If you'd like to request a new language, head to the [language support
meta-issue](https://github.com/raxod502/riju/issues/24) and add a
comment. Of course, if you actually want it to be added anytime soon,
you should submit a pull request :)
