# Riju

Riju is an online playground for every programming language. In less
than a second, you can start playing with a Python interpreter or
compiling INTERCAL code.

Check out the [live application](https://riju-sandbox.herokuapp.com/)!

**You should not do any sensitive work on Riju, as NO GUARANTEES are
made about its security or privacy. (No warranty etc etc.)**

This project is a work in progress, and I don't intend on thoroughly
documenting it until it has reached feature-completeness. As such,
you have reached the end of the README :)
