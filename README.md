# Riju

Riju is a very fast online playground for every programming language.
In less than a second, you can start playing with a Python interpreter
or compiling INTERCAL code.

Check out the [live application](https://riju-sandbox.herokuapp.com/)!

**You should not write any sensitive code on Riju, as NO GUARANTEES
are made about the security or privacy of your data. (No warranty etc
etc.)**

This project is a work in progress, and I don't intend on thoroughly
documenting it until it has reached feature-completeness. As such,
you have reached the end of the README :)
