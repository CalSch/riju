# Riju

Riju is a very fast online playground for every programming language.
In less than a second, you can start playing with a Python interpreter
or compiling [INTERCAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTERCAL) code.

Check it out at the <https://riju.codes>!

## Is it free?

Riju is free and always will be free for everyone.

However, if Riju gets popular enough, I won't be able to afford paying
for the hosting myself. To help me keep Riju online, you can donate
via Patreon. All donations are used solely to cover hosting costs, and
any surplus is donated to the [Electronic Frontier
Foundation](https://www.eff.org/).

## Is it safe?

Riju does not collect your personal information.

* Your code is deleted from the server as soon as you close Riju.
* Your terminal input and output is never saved or logged anywhere.
* Riju uses [Fathom Analytics](https://usefathom.com/) to measure
  traffic. Fathom collects very limited data and does not sell it to
  third parties, unlike Google Analytics.
* Riju does not serve advertisements.

All of the above notwithstanding, any service that allows people to
run code online is inherently risky. For this reason, I can't make any
guarantees about the security or privacy of your data.
