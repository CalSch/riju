# Riju financials

This directory has a Python script that can download and analyze
billing data from AWS to determine how much Riju actually costs. This
information is then made publicly available in per-month
subdirectories here; for some months with unusual charges I've added
commentary to explain what was going on.

This information is then imported into [Riju's master budgeting
spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15Us9KLXaJ6B1lNhrM6GV6JmmeKqNc8NNeTnaWiAhozw/edit?usp=sharing)
which compares spending to donations in order to determine whether we
are making a profit (we are not...). Once we start making a profit we
can start donating to the EFF as promised, or scale up Riju's
infrastructure to support more users for free.
