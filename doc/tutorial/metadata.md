# Tutorial: providing metadata

Recently I've been trying to add semantic metadata to each language,
to be used for categorization and search of the ever-growing number of
languages.

I promise I will write detailed documentation on the format of this
metadata "soon", but for now please see the JSON Schema and examples
in some existing languages!
